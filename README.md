## Installation
Clone or download this repository on GitHub: https://github.com/edoliva/README-Generator  
## Criteria
- The user must must run "npm install", then enter "node index.js" in terminal to begin the README Generator application.
- The user will need to have their GitHub repo link, the deployed link to their application, their GitHub username, and an email address.
## Usage/coding:
- This JS application was written to allow for a clean user experience. The general logic is as follows:
   - Once the initial criteria above is met, the user will respond to a series of prompts.
   - The prompts will populate a Template Literal in the form of a user friendly README.
   - Blank responses will not effect the functionality. 
   - User respones will be used in various ways; some stand alone, while others concatenate to predefined text in the Template Literal.  

- Licensing:
   - The user is given a "confirm" prompt to see if they want to use a license, if their response is "n", then no further license prompts will be displayed.
   - If they answer "y" then they can choose from 4 pre-defined license types. 
   - This choice will drive the results of an IF STATEMENT inside a function, displaying the license badge atop the READNE, as well as a link the the license details at the bottom of the README. 

- Screenshot information:
   - If the user would like to enter screenshots, by indicating a "y" response to that prompt, then:
      1) Through a function, the Screenshot section of the table of contents will be created. If a "n" response is given then there will be no Screenshot section in the table of contents. 
      2) A Screenshot header will be created in the body of the README through another function. 
      3) Regardless of the user choice, there will never be an "undefined" output in the README.
   - Using Ternary Operators, the screenshot descritpions and url will be populated in the body of the README.
   - Ternary Operators were used to avoid the "undefined" result of a blank user entry. 
   - The user can enter up to 4 screenshots. They will only be asked if they want to submit a screenshot if their previous response was "y". Once they answer "n" the screenshot prompts will terminate.
